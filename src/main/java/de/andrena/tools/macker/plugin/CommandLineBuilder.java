 * Helper class for storing long command lines inside a temporary file.

 *  builder = new CommandLineBuilder();
 *  builder.addArg(&quot;--someoption&quot;);
 *  builder.addArg(&quot;optionValue&quot;);
 *  ...
 *  builder.saveArgs();

 * </pre>
 *
 * It will save options in <code>builder.getCommandLineFile()</code>.  Options
 * will be stored one in a line.  Options are saved in UTF-8 encoding.
